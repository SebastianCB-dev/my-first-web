# My first website

This was my first website. It was created using HTML. It was a simple website with a elements. It was a great learning experience for me. I learned a lot about web development. It's nothing fancy but it was a great start for me.

I developed this website when I went to school. I was in 8th grade. I was very excited to learn web development. I was very curious about how websites work.

This website was made by:
- Joan Sebastián Carrillo Barón
- John Jairo Casallas Otero
